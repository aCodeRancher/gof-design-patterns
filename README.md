# Introduction

This repository contains GoF Design Patterns Examples used in my book "GoF Design Patterns Distilled".

# The book

"GoF Design Patterns Distilled" provides straight to a point, distilled explanation of GoF Design Patterns, originally
introduced in the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm,
Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides.

The book covers all 23 design patterns, divided into three groups: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.

Each design pattern is presented with a description, use cases, a diagram, and a meaningful example code. Example code
is written in Java.

The goal of this book is to teach you design patterns using meaningful examples and straight to the point descriptions.
